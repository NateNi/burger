# burger

## What the project does
This website allows the user to submit names of burgers that they would like to eat.  After submitting a new burger, it is displayed with the option to devour it.  By devouring a burger, it gets moved into the devoured burger section.
## Why the project is useful
This project was an activity designed to get acclimated with handlebars, which is used for generating the front-end of the website. It is also helpful for a user to store hamburgers they would like to eat, and have already eaten.
## How users can get started with the project
Type a name under "Add a burger" and hit the Submit button to create a new burger in the "Burgers to be devoured" field.  Click the button next to a burger to devour it and move the burger to the "Burgers that have been devoured" field.
